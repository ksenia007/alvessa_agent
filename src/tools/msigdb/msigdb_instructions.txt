Instructions to download and parse MSigDB data for use in Alvessa:

In order to get access to MSigDB downloadable gene set data will need to register at this link: https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/login.jsp. 
Once you have access to download the data, you should download the 'Human Gene Set JSON file set (ZIPped)' folder. 
Out of this folder, extract the full MSigDB annotations file (it should be formatted similar to 'msigdb.v2026.1.Hs.json') and place in the 'local_dbs' folder.
Run the following command to preprocess the MSigDB data:
    python process_msigdb.py name_of_your_full_MSigDB_annotation_file
You should now be able to run the OMIM tool through Alvessa.
