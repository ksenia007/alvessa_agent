Also functions as a lipid phosphatase, removing the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, PtdIns(3,4)P2/phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate and PtdIns3P/phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate with a preference for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 . Furthermore, this enzyme can also act as a cytosolic inositol 3-phosphatase acting on Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5/inositol 1,3,4,5,6 pentakisphosphate and possibly Ins(1,3,4,5)P4/1D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate .

In motile cells, suppresses the formation of lateral pseudopods and thereby promotes cell polarization and directed movement . Dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesion formation . Required for growth factor-induced epithelial cell migration; growth factor stimulation induces PTEN phosphorylation which changes its binding preference from the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI3K kinase complex to DLC1 and results in translocation of the PTEN-DLC1 complex to the posterior of migrating cells to promote RHOA activation . Meanwhile, TNS3 switches binding preference from DLC1 to p85 and the TNS3-p85 complex translocates to the leading edge of migrating cells to activate RAC1 activation .
