transcription factor that induces cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis upon binding to its target DNA sequence (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:35618207, PubMed:36634798, PubMed:38653238, PubMed:9840937). Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17189187, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:38653238, PubMed:9840937). Negatively regulates cell division by controlling expression of a set of genes required for this process (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:9840937). One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression (PubMed:12524540, PubMed:17189187). Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (PubMed:12524540). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (PubMed:12524540). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2

transcription factor that induces cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis upon binding to its target DNA sequence (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:35618207, PubMed:36634798, PubMed:38653238, PubMed:9840937). Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17189187, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:38653238, PubMed:9840937). Negatively regulates cell division by controlling expression of a set of genes required for this process (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:9840937). One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression (PubMed:12524540, PubMed:17189187). Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (PubMed:12524540). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (PubMed:12524540). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2

Interacts with PRMT5 in response to DNA damage; the interaction is TTC5/STRAP dependent (PubMed:19011621). Interacts with PPP1R13L (via SH3 domain and ANK repeats); the interaction inhibits pro-apoptotic activity of p53/TP53 (PubMed:12524540). Interacts with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 and TP53BP2/ASPP2; the interactions promotes pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:12524540). When phosphorylated at Ser-15, interacts with DDX3X and gamma-tubulin (PubMed:28842590). Interacts with KAT7/HBO1; leading to inhibit histone acetyltransferase activity of KAT7/HBO1 (PubMed:17954561). Interacts (via N-terminus) with E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MUL1; the interaction results in ubiquitination of cytoplasmic TP53 at Lys-24 and subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:21597459). Interacts with S100A4; this interaction promotes TP53 degradation (PubMed:23752197, PubMed:32442400). Interacts with BANP (By similarity). Interacts with TTC5/STRAP; the interaction may result in increased mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis (PubMed:25168243). Interacts with NQO1; this interaction is NADH-dependent, stabilizes TP53 in response to oxidative stress and protects it from ubiquitin-independent degradation by the 20S proteasome (PubMed:15687255). Interacts with DAZAP2 at TP53 target gene promoters; the interaction is triggered by DNA damage and leads to modulation of the expression of a subset of TP53 target genes, reducing DNA damage-induced cell death by limiting the expression of cell death-mediating TP53 target genes (PubMed:33591310). Interacts (via N-terminus) with ZNF768 (via zinc-finger domains); interaction might be facilitated by TP53 oligomerization state (PubMed:34404770). Forms a ternary complex with ALDOB and G6PD; this interaction is direct. ALDOB stabilizes the complex inhibiting G6PD activity and keeping oxidative pentose phosphate metabolism in check. Interacts with MORN3; the interactions mediate post-transcriptional modifications of TP53 by MDM2 and SIRT1 (PubMed:29681526). Interacts with HSPA9/MOT-2; the interaction promotes the degradation of TP53 (PubMed:24625977). Interacts with FBXO22; this interaction promotes TP53 proteasomal degradation (PubMed:26868148)"}],"commentType":"SUBUNIT"},{"texts":[{"evidences":[{"evidenceCode":"ECO:0000269","source":"PubMed","id":"2175676"}],"value":"(Microbial infection) Interacts with cancer-associated/HPV E6 viral proteins leading to ubiquitination and degradation of TP53 giving a possible model for cell growth regulation.
