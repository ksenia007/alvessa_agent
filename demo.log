=== START: Which of the following genes is a computationally predicted human gene target of the miRNA MIR3140_5P according to miRDB v6.0?   A. TMCC3 B. EDEM3 C. ATP6V1B1 D. GBP2 ===
[TOOL SELECTION PROMPT] You are an assistant deciding which tools to use to answer a biomedical question. User question: """Which of the following genes is a computationally predicted human gene target of the miRNA MIR3140_5P according to miRDB v6.0?   A. TMCC3 B. EDEM3 C. ATP6V1B1 D. GBP2""" 

 Available tools: - extract_entities: Extracts genes and all biomedical entities from the user question for query understanding using both Claude and GLiNER models. Returns genes (Claude + GLiNER), traits, and all entity types found by GLiNER. This tool MUST be called first before running any other tool as it provides essential entity extraction for pipeline execution.
- expand_gene_set_by_trait: Use this tool ONLY IF the expanded gene set by a trait is REQUIRED to answer the question. This could be used to discover more relevant genes underlying a trait, if a broader genetic context would be valuable for the analysis. Searches for genetic associations with diseases, traits, or phenotypes mentioned in the user query and expands the gene list with additional related genes found through GWAS associations. 
- gencode_gene_node: Annotates genes with GENCODE gene annotations such as transcripts, number exons, genomic span. Essential for many downstream analyses.
- humanbase_functions: Fetch per-gene functional predictions from HumanBase tissue-specific networks. Provides expanded list of functions.
- uniprot_base: Queries UniProt for functional annotations and disease links.
- query_gwas_by_gene: Retrieves genome-wide association study (GWAS) results for a given gene. It collects traits and diseases associated with genetic variants linked to that gene, along with the specific variants
- query_gwas_extensive: This is a more comprehensive version of the query_gwas_by_gene tool, and it is used to retrieve more detailed information about the GWAS results. It collects an extensive list of traits/diseases associated with an extensive list of genetic variants linked to that gene. Use this tool *ONLY* if the question is very specific that requires what is equivalent to an extensive database search, not to general characterisation of the gene.
- uniprot_gwas: Runs UniProt query again on genes identified via GWAS associations. Helps to expand the base annotations with related genes.
- BioGRID: Fetches gene interactions from BioGRID and their functional annotations for the input genes. Provides a curated context-specific list of protein-protein, genetic and chemical interactions.
- reactome: Fetches Reactome pathways associated with the input genes. Provides a curated collection of biological pathways which describe how molecules interact within a cell to carry out different biological processes.
- Summarize_bioGRID_GO: Required for BioGrid. Summarizes BioGRID GO terms for the input genes. Provides a compact list of GO terms for the input genes.
- variant_annotations: Fetches dbSNP data about the identified variants. This requires gwas to be run first. This is to be used only when the variant needs to be annotated with its **coordinates** and **chromosome number** and similar details. This tool is also a prerequisite to run humanbase, sei, alphamissense, etc. Reason based on the user's question if sequence models need to be run, and if so, this tool is a prerequisite to run them.
- variant_population_summaries: Fetches population-wide summaries of allele frequencies for the identified variants across studies. Useful for characterizing the frequency of variants in the population. This requires gwas to be run first.
- sei: Fetches predictions of the sequence regulatory activity for given variants. This requires variant_annotations to be run first.
- humanbase_expecto: Fetches Expecto, gene expression disruption predictions from HumanBase per variant. Pulls all precomputed predictions for the input genes.
- humanbase_tissue_expecto_annotate_variants: Annotates variants with tissue-specific expression disruption predictions from HumanBase. Requires humanbase_expecto and variant_annotations to be run first.
- alphamissense: Fetches Alphamissense predicted pathogenicity classes for given variants. This requires variant_annotations to be run first.
- miRDB: Fetches miRDB computationally predicted gene targets of miRNA..

 Examples workflows: EXAMPLE PIPELINES (pay attention to dependencies):

1. Variant regulatory activity (e.g. SEI):
   extract_entities → query_gwas_by_gene → variant_annotations → sei

2. Variant pathogenicity (e.g. AlphaMissense):
   extract_entities → query_gwas_by_gene → variant_annotations → alphamissense

3. HumanBase Expecto variant annotation:
   extract_entities → humanbase_expecto → query_gwas_by_gene → variant_annotations → humanbase_tissue_expecto_annotate_variants

4. Gene-level functional annotation:
   extract_entities → gencode_gene_node → (humanbase_functions, uniprot_base, reactome, BioGRID) → Summarize_bioGRID_GO (if BioGRID run) → uniprot_gwas (if gwas run)

Note these are only examples, and in real life you may need to run combinations of these tools depending on the user intent and the entities extracted.

[conditioned_claude_node] system message: You are a biology data analyst. Answer strictly with facts you can point to inside CONTEXT. Respond only with JSON with keys answer and evidence. Ensure proper JSON format. Produce raw json output. I don't want markdown. The 'evidence' field must always be a list of short strings, and always reference the entity to which you are referring. If the CONTEXT contains trait-based associations (query_type: 'trait_based'), focus on the genetic associations with the queried trait/disease, including related genes, variants, and their biological significance.
