=== START: Out of these variants, which one is associated with trait 'Serum levels of protein YWHAQ;SFN;YWHAB;YWHAE;YWHAG;YWHAH;YWHAZ' for gene CFH? ===
[TOOL SELECTION PROMPT] You are an assistant deciding which tools to use to answer a biomedical question. User question: """Out of these variants, which one is associated with trait 'Serum levels of protein YWHAQ;SFN;YWHAB;YWHAE;YWHAG;YWHAH;YWHAZ' for gene CFH?""" Extracted gene symbols: None Available tools: - extract_entities: Extracts genes and all biomedical entities from the user question for query understanding using both Claude and GLiNER models. Returns genes (Claude + GLiNER), traits, and all entity types found by GLiNER. This tool MUST be called first before running any other tool as it provides essential entity extraction for pipeline execution.
- query_by_trait: Consider using this tool ONLY when traits are detected in the query, and ONLY IF the expanded gene set is REQUIRED to answer the question, potentially discover more relevant genes, especially when the current gene list is small or when broader genetic context would be valuable for the analysis. Found traits extracted in the query, it could be expanded by running this tool. Searches for genetic associations with diseases, traits, or phenotypes mentioned in the user query and expands the gene list with additional related genes found through GWAS associations. 
- gencode_gene_node: Annotates genes with GENCODE gene annotations. Provides gene-level information such as gene name, description, and genomic coordinates. Essential for many downstream analyses.
- humanbase_functions: Fetch per-gene functional predictions from HumanBase tissue-specific networks. Provides expanded list of functions.
- uniprot_base: Queries UniProt for functional annotations and disease links
- gwas: Fetches GWAS associations for genes, including diseases, related variants and genes. Population-level variant associations from common variants.
- uniprot_gwas: Runs UniProt query again on genes identified via GWAS associations. Helps to expand the base annotations with related genes.
- BioGRID: Fetches gene interactions from BioGRID and their functional annotations for the input genes. Provides a curated context-specific list of protein-protein, genetic and chemical interactions.
- reactome: Fetches Reactome pathways associated with the input genes. Provides a curated collection of biological pathways which describe how molecules interact within a cell to carry out different biological processes.
- Summarize_bioGRID_GO: Required for BioGrid. Summarizes BioGRID GO terms for the input genes. Provides a compact list of GO terms for the input genes.
- dbsnp: Fetches dbSNP data about the identified variants. This requires gwas to be run first.
- sei: Fetches predictions of the sequence regulatory activity for given variants. This requires dbsnp to be run first.
- humanbase_expecto: Fetches Expecto, gene expression disruption predictions from HumanBase per variant. Pulls all precomputed predictions for the input genes.
- humanbase_tissue_expecto_annotate_variants: Annotates variants with tissue-specific expression disruption predictions from HumanBase. Requires humanbase_expecto and dbsnp to be run first.
- alphamissense: Fetches Alphamissense predicted pathogenicity classes for given variants. This requires dbsnp to be run first..
. 
 Examples workflows: EXAMPLE PIPELINES (pay attention to dependencies):

1. Variant regulatory activity (e.g. SEI):
   extract_entities → gwas → dbsnp → sei

2. Variant pathogenicity (e.g. AlphaMissense):
   extract_entities → gwas → dbsnp → alphamissense

3. HumanBase Expecto variant annotation:
   extract_entities → humanbase_expecto → gwas → dbsnp → humanbase_tissue_expecto_annotate_variants

4. Gene-level functional annotation:
   extract_entities → gencode_gene_node → (humanbase_functions, uniprot_base, reactome, BioGRID) → Summarize_bioGRID_GO (if BioGRID run) → uniprot_gwas (if gwas run)

Note these are only examples, and in real life you may need to run combinations of these tools depending on the user intent and the entities extracted.

 
 Which tools should be called, and in what order? Respond ONLY with a Python list of tool names. Example: ["query_by_trait", "humanbase_functions", "uniprot_base"] or ["humanbase_functions", "uniprot_base", "gwas"] or ["query_by_trait", "gwas", "BioGRID"]
