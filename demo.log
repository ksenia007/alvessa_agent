PubMed:38653238, PubMed:9840937). Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17189187, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:38653238, PubMed:9840937). Negatively regulates cell division by controlling expression of a set of genes required for this process (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:9840937). One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression (PubMed:12524540, PubMed:17189187). Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (PubMed:12524540). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (PubMed:12524540). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2
