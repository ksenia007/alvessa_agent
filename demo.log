Q: Which TFs bind in front of TP53
[TOOL SELECTION PROMPT] You are an assistant deciding which tools to use to answer a biomedical question. User question: """Which TFs bind in front of TP53""" 

 If the question mentioned a database or tool and we do not have it, use the most similar available one. Available tools: - extract_entities: Extracts genes and all biomedical entities from the user question for query understanding using both Claude and GLiNER models. Returns genes (Claude + GLiNER), traits, and all entity types found by GLiNER. This tool MUST be called first before running any other tool as it provides essential entity extraction for pipeline execution.
- gencode_gene_node: Annotates genes with GENCODE gene annotations such as transcripts, number exons, genomic span. Essential for many downstream analyses.
- humanbase_functions: Fetch per-gene functional predictions from HumanBase tissue-specific networks. Provides expanded list of functions.
- uniprot_base: Queries UniProt for functional annotations and disease links.
- query_gwas_by_gene: Retrieves genome-wide association study (GWAS) results for a given gene. It collects traits and diseases associated with genetic variants linked to that gene, along with the specific variants
- query_gwas_extensive: This is a more comprehensive version of the query_gwas_by_gene tool, and it is used to retrieve more detailed information about the GWAS results. It collects an extensive list of traits/diseases associated with an extensive list of genetic variants linked to that gene. Use this tool *ONLY* if the question is very specific that requires what is equivalent to an extensive database search, not to general characterisation of the gene.
- uniprot_gwas: Runs UniProt query again on genes identified via GWAS associations. Helps to expand the base annotations with related genes.
- BioGRID: Fetches gene interactions from BioGRID and their functional annotations for the input genes. Provides a curated context-specific list of protein-protein, genetic and chemical interactions.
- reactome: Fetches Reactome pathways associated with the input genes. Provides a curated collection of biological pathways which describe how molecules interact within a cell to carry out different biological processes.
- Summarize_GO: Summarizes GO terms for the input genes. Can only ber run after UniProt, needed to answer questions about GO terms or functions of genes.
- variant_annotations: Fetches dbSNP data about the identified variants. This requires gwas to be run first. This is to be used only when the variant needs to be annotated with its **coordinates** and **chromosome number** and similar details. This tool is also a prerequisite to run humanbase, sei, alphamissense, etc. Reason based on the user's question if sequence models need to be run, and if so, this tool is a prerequisite to run them.
- variant_population_summaries: Fetches population-wide summaries of allele frequencies for the identified variants across studies. Useful for characterizing the frequency of variants in the population. This requires gwas to be run first.
- sei: Fetches predictions of the sequence regulatory activity for given variants. This requires variant_annotations to be run first.
- expectosc_predictions_agent: Annotates variants with predicted (from sequence) cell type-specific expression disruption predictions. Requires variant_annotations to be run first.
- alphamissense: Fetches Alphamissense predicted pathogenicity classes for given variants. This requires variant_annotations to be run first.
- miRDB: Fetches miRDB computationally predicted gene targets of miRNA.
- remap_crm_agent: Fetches cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) from the ReMap 2022 database for each gene, reporting transcription factors with ChIP-seq binding peaks near gene’s TSS. Requires Gencode (gencode_gene_node) run first. Useful for exploring transcriptional regulation..

 Examples outputs look like this: EXAMPLE PIPELINES (pay attention to dependencies):

1. Variant regulatory activity (e.g. SEI):
   ["extract_entities", "query_gwas_by_gene", "variant_annotations", "sei"]

2. Variant pathogenicity (e.g. AlphaMissense):
   ["extract_entities", "query_gwas_by_gene", "variant_annotations", "alphamissense"] 

3. HumanBase Expecto variant annotation:
   ["extract_entities", "humanbase_expecto", "query_gwas_by_gene", "variant_annotations", "humanbase_tissue_expecto_annotate_variants"]

4. Gene-level functional annotation:
   ["extract_entities", "gencode_gene_node", "humanbase_functions", "uniprot_base", "reactome", "BioGRID", "Summarize_bioGRID_GO", "uniprot_gwas"]

Note these are only examples, and in real life you may need to run combinations of these tools **depending on the user intent and the entities extracted**.

Respond *ONLY* with a Python list of tool names. Example: ["humanbase_functions", "uniprot_base"] or ["humanbase_functions", "uniprot_base", "query_gwas_by_gene"] or ["query_gwas_by_gene", "BioGRID"]

IF YOU INCLUDE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A LIST OF TOOLS, YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED INVALID.

 ANY OTHER WORD INCLUDED IN THE RESPONSE WILL BE CONSIDERED INVALID.You are an assistant deciding which tools to use to answer a biomedical question. User question: """Which TFs bind in front of TP53""" 

 If the question mentioned a database or tool and we do not have it, use the most similar available one. Available tools: - extract_entities: Extracts genes and all biomedical entities from the user question for query understanding using both Claude and GLiNER models. Returns genes (Claude + GLiNER), traits, and all entity types found by GLiNER. This tool MUST be called first before running any other tool as it provides essential entity extraction for pipeline execution.
- gencode_gene_node: Annotates genes with GENCODE gene annotations such as transcripts, number exons, genomic span. Essential for many downstream analyses.
- humanbase_functions: Fetch per-gene functional predictions from HumanBase tissue-specific networks. Provides expanded list of functions.
- uniprot_base: Queries UniProt for functional annotations and disease links.
- query_gwas_by_gene: Retrieves genome-wide association study (GWAS) results for a given gene. It collects traits and diseases associated with genetic variants linked to that gene, along with the specific variants
- query_gwas_extensive: This is a more comprehensive version of the query_gwas_by_gene tool, and it is used to retrieve more detailed information about the GWAS results. It collects an extensive list of traits/diseases associated with an extensive list of genetic variants linked to that gene. Use this tool *ONLY* if the question is very specific that requires what is equivalent to an extensive database search, not to general characterisation of the gene.
- uniprot_gwas: Runs UniProt query again on genes identified via GWAS associations. Helps to expand the base annotations with related genes.
- BioGRID: Fetches gene interactions from BioGRID and their functional annotations for the input genes. Provides a curated context-specific list of protein-protein, genetic and chemical interactions.
- reactome: Fetches Reactome pathways associated with the input genes. Provides a curated collection of biological pathways which describe how molecules interact within a cell to carry out different biological processes.
- Summarize_GO: Summarizes GO terms for the input genes. Can only ber run after UniProt, needed to answer questions about GO terms or functions of genes.
- variant_annotations: Fetches dbSNP data about the identified variants. This requires gwas to be run first. This is to be used only when the variant needs to be annotated with its **coordinates** and **chromosome number** and similar details. This tool is also a prerequisite to run humanbase, sei, alphamissense, etc. Reason based on the user's question if sequence models need to be run, and if so, this tool is a prerequisite to run them.
- variant_population_summaries: Fetches population-wide summaries of allele frequencies for the identified variants across studies. Useful for characterizing the frequency of variants in the population. This requires gwas to be run first.
- sei: Fetches predictions of the sequence regulatory activity for given variants. This requires variant_annotations to be run first.
- expectosc_predictions_agent: Annotates variants with predicted (from sequence) cell type-specific expression disruption predictions. Requires variant_annotations to be run first.
- alphamissense: Fetches Alphamissense predicted pathogenicity classes for given variants. This requires variant_annotations to be run first.
- miRDB: Fetches miRDB computationally predicted gene targets of miRNA.
- remap_crm_agent: Fetches cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) from the ReMap 2022 database for each gene, reporting transcription factors with ChIP-seq binding peaks near gene’s TSS. Requires Gencode (gencode_gene_node) run first. Useful for exploring transcriptional regulation..

 Examples outputs look like this: EXAMPLE PIPELINES (pay attention to dependencies):

1. Variant regulatory activity (e.g. SEI):
   ["extract_entities", "query_gwas_by_gene", "variant_annotations", "sei"]

2. Variant pathogenicity (e.g. AlphaMissense):
   ["extract_entities", "query_gwas_by_gene", "variant_annotations", "alphamissense"] 

3. HumanBase Expecto variant annotation:
   ["extract_entities", "humanbase_expecto", "query_gwas_by_gene", "variant_annotations", "humanbase_tissue_expecto_annotate_variants"]

4. Gene-level functional annotation:
   ["extract_entities", "gencode_gene_node", "humanbase_functions", "uniprot_base", "reactome", "BioGRID", "Summarize_bioGRID_GO", "uniprot_gwas"]

Note these are only examples, and in real life you may need to run combinations of these tools **depending on the user intent and the entities extracted**.

Respond *ONLY* with a Python list of tool names. Example: ["humanbase_functions", "uniprot_base"] or ["humanbase_functions", "uniprot_base", "query_gwas_by_gene"] or ["query_gwas_by_gene", "BioGRID"]

IF YOU INCLUDE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A LIST OF TOOLS, YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED INVALID.
