The functional consequences include: rs3807306 is an intronic variant with B-cell-like regulatory activity that shows tissue-specific expression effects, with highest expression in GABAergic interneurons and lowest in kidney-derived immune cells. rs2070197 is a 3' UTR variant with monocyte/macrophage regulatory activity, located in a functionally important region for post-transcriptional regulation. Both variants affect IRF5, a transcription factor critical for innate immunity and interferon signaling.\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"rs3807306 associated with kidney cancer (p=8e-18, risk score=0.91)\",\n    \"rs3807306 associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (p=1e-13, risk score=0.91)\",\n    \"rs2070197 associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (p=6e-24, risk score=1.88)\",\n    \"rs3807306 has E5 B-cell-like regulatory activity\",\n    \"rs2070197 has E7 Monocyte/Macrophage regulatory activity\",\n    \"rs3807306 is an intron_variant in IRF5\",\n    \"rs2070197 is a 3_prime_UTR_variant in IRF5\",\n    \"IRF5 function: Transcription factor that plays a critical role in innate immunity by activating expression of type I interferon\",\n    \"rs3807306 shows highest expression effects in GABAergic interneurons and lowest in kidney-derived immune cells\",\n    \"rs2070197 shows highest expression effects in DC activated/lung and lowest in brain neurons\"\n  ]\n}"

The functional consequences include: rs3807306 is an intronic variant with B-cell-like regulatory activity that shows tissue-specific expression effects, with highest expression in GABAergic interneurons and lowest in kidney-derived immune cells. rs2070197 is a 3' UTR variant with monocyte/macrophage regulatory activity, located in a functionally important region for post-transcriptional regulation. Both variants affect IRF5, a transcription factor critical for innate immunity and interferon signaling.",
