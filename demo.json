      "function": "Multifunctional transcription factor that induces cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis upon binding to its target DNA sequence . Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type . Negatively regulates cell division by controlling expression of a set of genes required for this process . One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression . Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 . However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP . In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2",

    "answer": "{\n  \"answer\": \"TP53 has numerous variants with different functional and clinical significance. Key variants include rs1042522 (Pro72Arg), a common polymorphism with likely benign pathogenicity predictions, and rs28934576, a rare variant with likely pathogenic predictions. Most TP53 variants are located in transcriptionally active regions (TN1-TN4) or promoter regions, with allele frequencies varying widely across populations. The rs2909430 variant shows significant population differences, being more common in African populations (~16%) compared to East Asian populations (~3%). Several variants like rs78378222 and rs17883687 are rare (<3% frequency) but located in important regulatory regions.\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"TP53 pathogenicity predictions show rs28934576 as 'likely_pathogenic' for all alternate alleles\",\n    \"TP53 rs1042522 shows 'likely_benign' pathogenicity predictions\",\n    \"TP53 regulatory regions include 'TN1 Transcription', 'TN2 Transcription', 'TN4 Transcription', and 'P Promoter' for various variants\",\n    \"TP53 rs2909430 shows population frequency differences: 0.16466432430390268 in TOPMED vs 0.020945247933884296 in TOMMO\",\n    \"TP53 rs78378222 has low frequency: 0.002654590880699563 in 1000Genomes_30X\",\n    \"TP53 rs17883687 has frequency 0.9760738977671993 for reference allele in TOPMED\",\n    \"TP53 functions include 'DNA repair', 'regulation of DNA binding transcription factor activity', 'intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway'\",\n    \"TP53 diseases include 'Li-Fraumeni syndrome', 'Lung cancer', 'Esophageal cancer'\"\n  ]\n}",
