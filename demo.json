the given gene, diseases and functions:: {diseases: Growth retardation, developmental delay, and facial dysmorphism, Obesity, function: RNA demethylase that mediates oxidative demethylation of different RNA species, such as mRNAs, tRNAs and snRNAs, and acts as a regulator of fat mass, adipogenesis and energy homeostasis . Specifically demethylates N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA, the most prevalent internal modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) in higher eukaryotes . M6A demethylation by FTO affects mRNA expression and stability . Also able to demethylate m6A in U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) . Mediates demethylation of N(6),2'-O-dimethyladenosine cap (m6A(m)), by demethylating the N(6)-methyladenosine at the second transcribed position of mRNAs and U6 snRNA . Demethylation of m6A(m) in the 5'-cap by FTO affects mRNA stability by promoting susceptibility to decapping . Also acts as a tRNA demethylase by removing N(1)-methyladenine from various tRNAs . Has no activity towards 1-methylguanine . Has no detectable activity towards double-stranded DNA . Also able to repair alkylated DNA and RNA by oxidative demethylation: demethylates single-stranded RNA containing 3-methyluracil, single-stranded DNA containing 3-methylthymine and has low demethylase activity towards single-stranded DNA containing 1-methyladenine or 3-methylcytosine . Ability to repair alkylated DNA and RNA is however unsure in vivo . Involved in the regulation of fat mass, adipogenesis and body weight, thereby contributing to the regulation of body size and body fat accumulation . Involved in the regulation of thermogenesis and the control of adipocyte differentiation into brown or white fat cells . Regulates activity of the dopaminergic midbrain circuitry via its ability to demethylate m6A in mRNAs (By similarity). Plays an oncogenic role in a number of acute myeloid leukemias by enhancing leukemic oncogene-mediated cell transformation: acts by mediating m6A demethylation of target transcripts such as MYC,

    "answer": "Based on the available data, FTO variants are associated with increased BMI and breast cancer risk, but the specific mechanism linking BMI-increasing FTO variants to lower breast cancer risk is not directly explained in the provided context. The data shows that FTO variant rs7193144 is associated with both breast cancer (p-value: 3e-16, risk score: 0.0864) and metabolic syndrome, while multiple other FTO variants are strongly associated with increased BMI. However, the biological pathway connecting these associations - particularly how high childhood BMI might lead to reduced adult breast cancer risk - is not detailed in the molecular or pathway information provided.",
