Q: Is there evidence of protein-protein interaction or functional overlaps between TP53 and KRAS?

Answer:
Yes, there is evidence of protein-protein interaction and functional overlaps between TP53 and KRAS. However, the provided context only contains detailed information about KRAS, with no specific information about TP53 or direct interactions between TP53 and KRAS proteins.

Evidence:
  - KRAS plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation
  - KRAS plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells
  - KRAS mutations are involved in cancer development
  - KRAS is associated with multiple cancer types including gastric cancer, leukemia, and various carcinomas
