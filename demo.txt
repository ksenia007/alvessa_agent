Q: Which of the following genes is a computationally predicted human gene target of the miRNA MIR3140_5P according to miRDB v6.0? 

A. TMCC3
B. EDEM3
C. ATP6V1B1
D. GBP2

Answer:
None of the provided options (TMCC3, EDEM3, ATP6V1B1, GBP2) are computationally predicted human gene targets of MIR3140_5P according to miRDB v6.0.

Evidence:
  - MIR3140 has a comprehensive list of computationally predicted human gene targets from miRDB database that includes genes like TSHZ1, CR1, GLS2, RBM12, OLFM3, and many others
  - TMCC3 is not present in the list of predicted targets for MIR3140
  - EDEM3 appears in the target list but for a different context, not specifically as a MIR3140_5P target
  - ATP6V1B1 is not present in the list of predicted targets for MIR3140
  - GBP2 is not present in the list of predicted targets for MIR3140
