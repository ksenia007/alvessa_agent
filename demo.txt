Q: Tell me about variants in TP53

Answer:
TP53 has numerous variants identified through GWAS studies, with 239 total associations and 235 significant associations across 72 studies. Key high-risk variants include rs17880847, rs28934576, rs78378222, rs74351250, rs572488097, rs201214141, rs17881850, rs1642792, rs62062585, rs138932666, rs78496430, rs17883687, rs1042522, rs55745760, rs1625895, rs8073498, rs17882854, rs2909430, rs4968204, and rs9894946. These variants are associated with various disease traits including uterine fibroids, glioblastoma, glioma, skin cancer, colon polyp, and basal cell carcinoma. The variants show different regulatory activities, with some located in transcription regions (TN1, TN2, TN3, TN4), promoter regions (P), and other regulatory elements. Pathogenicity predictions show rs1042522 as benign and rs28934576 as pathogenic. The variants also show tissue-specific expression disruption patterns, with the strongest positive effect variant being chr17:7590695 C>G in skeletal muscle and the strongest negative effect variant being chr17:7590666 G>T in keratinocytes.
