Q: How many variants are identified for TP53 and PTEN? What does it imply about the genes in terms of regulatory activity and pathogenicity?

Answer:
TP53 has 42 variants identified, while PTEN has 42 variants identified. For regulatory activity, TP53 variants show diverse roles including promoter regions (P Promoter), transcription factors (TF3 FOXA1/AR/ESR1), transcriptional activity (TN1-TN4 Transcription), stem cell activity (E1 Stem cell), and heterochromatin regions. PTEN variants also show diverse regulatory roles including transcription factors (TF1 NANOG/FOXA1, TF3 FOXA1/AR/ESR1, TF5 AR), transcriptional activity (TN1-TN4 Transcription), stem cell activity (E1 Stem cell), and various tissue-specific enhancers. For pathogenicity, TP53 has variants with likely pathogenic (rs28934576) and likely benign (rs1042522, rs560191) predictions, while all PTEN variants show null pathogenicity predictions, indicating they are likely non-missense variants.

Evidence:
  - TP53 gwas_high_risk_snps contains 42 variants
  - PTEN gwas_high_risk_snps contains 42 variants
  - TP53 regulatory activity shows rs181067279: P Promoter, rs17883687: P Promoter, rs896855: P Promoter
  - TP53 regulatory activity shows rs113910919: TF3 FOXA1 / AR / ESR1, rs62523081: TF3 FOXA1 / AR / ESR1
  - TP53 regulatory activity shows rs2303287: TN1 Transcription, rs78378222: TN4 Transcription
  - PTEN regulatory activity shows rs644205: TF1 NANOG / FOXA1, rs149071840: TF3 FOXA1 / AR / ESR1, rs2673824: TF5 AR
  - PTEN regulatory activity shows rs478839: E1 Stem cell, rs1234214: E1 Stem cell
  - TP53 pathogenicity shows rs28934576: likely_pathogenic, rs1042522: likely_benign, rs560191: likely_benign
  - PTEN pathogenicity predictions all show null values
