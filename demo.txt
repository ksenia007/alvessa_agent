Q: Which TFs bind in front of TP53

Answer:
Looking at the provided context, I need to identify transcription factors (TFs) that bind in front of the TP53 gene.

  "answer": "Based on the ReMap Cis Regulatory Modules data, 685 unique transcription factors are predicted to bind within 1000bp upstream and downstream of the TP53 gene (chr17:7687546 +/-1000bp). Key transcription factors that bind in front of TP53 include: TP53 itself (autoregulation), MYC, MAX, E2F family members (E2F1, E2F3, E2F4, E2F6, E2F7, E2F8), p53 family members (TP63), NF-κB pathway components (NFKB1, NFKB2, RELA, RELB), STAT family (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT5B), AP-1 components (FOS, JUN, JUNB, JUND, FOSL1, FOSL2), CREB/ATF family (CREB1, ATF2, ATF3, ATF4, ATF7), and chromatin remodeling complexes (SMARCA4, SMARCA2, CREBBP, EP300). The analysis identified 3 peaks with binding sites for these factors.",
