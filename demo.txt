Q: Which of the following genes is a computationally predicted human gene target of the miRNA MIR3140_5P according to miRDB v6.0? 

A. TMCC3
B. EDEM3
C. ATP6V1B1
D. GBP2

Answer:
EDEM3

Evidence:
  - MIR3140 has computationally predicted gene targets from the miRDB database that include EDEM3 in the human target list
  - EDEM3 appears in the comprehensive list of human gene targets for MIR3140 according to miRDB v6.0
