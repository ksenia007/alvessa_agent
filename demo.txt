Q: Is there evidence of protein-protein interaction or functional overlaps between TP53 and KRAS?

Answer:
No, there is no evidence of direct protein-protein interaction between TP53 and KRAS in the provided context.

Evidence:
  - TP53 interaction data shows extensive protein-protein interactions with 150+ proteins including MDM2, EP300, CREBBP, USP7, and many others, but KRAS is not listed among TP53's interacting partners
  - The biogrid_derived_interacting_genes_summary for TP53 describes 12 interacting genes (PPP1CC, APTX, UBE2L3, PSMD7, WDR48, Rchy1, SMARCB1, Apc, BAG1, SHANK3, RPS4X, RSBN1) but does not include KRAS
  - No KRAS data is provided in the context to assess potential interactions from the KRAS perspective
