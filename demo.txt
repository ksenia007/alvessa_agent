Q: Tell me about exons in TP53

Answer:
TP53 has 24 different transcripts with varying exon numbers. The number of exons per transcript ranges from 7 to 12 exons. The shortest transcript (ENST00000413465.6) has 7 exons, while several transcripts including ENST00000420246.6, ENST00000455263.6, ENST00000610538.4, and ENST00000622645.4 have the maximum of 12 exons. The transcript spans range from 7,092 base pairs to 19,137 base pairs, and the entire TP53 gene spans from position 7,661,779 to 7,687,546 base pairs.
