Q: Tell me about role of TP53 variants in GWAS catalogue

Answer:
TP53 variants show extensive associations in GWAS catalogue with 239 total associations across 72 studies, with 235 being statistically significant. High-risk SNPs include rs17880847, rs28934576, rs78378222, and others, associated with diverse traits including uterine fibroids, glioblastoma, skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and metabolic parameters like sex hormone-binding globulin levels and body fat percentage. The variants show regulatory activity in transcriptional regions (TN1-TN4), promoter regions, and stem cell enhancers. Pathogenicity predictions indicate rs28934576 as pathogenic and rs1042522 as benign. Tissue-specific expression analysis reveals strongest effects in muscle skeletal and keratinocyte tissues, with variants showing differential expression modulation across 218 tissues.
