Q: What microRNAs regulate the cancer-related functions of TP53, and how are these connected to pathways and protein interactions?

Answer:
The provided context does not contain specific information about microRNAs that regulate the cancer-related functions of TP53. The context focuses primarily on protein-protein interactions, pathways, and transcriptional regulation of TP53, but does not include data about microRNA regulation of TP53 or its cancer-related functions.

Evidence:
  - The context contains extensive protein interaction data for TP53 from BioGRID database
  - The context includes Reactome pathway associations for TP53 including cancer-related pathways
  - The context describes TP53 function as a tumor suppressor that induces cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis
  - No microRNA regulatory information is present in the provided TP53 data
