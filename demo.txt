Q: Tell me about regulatory role of TP53 variants

Answer:
TP53 variants play crucial regulatory roles through multiple mechanisms. The variants are located in key regulatory regions including promoters (rs1042522, rs17881850, rs17880847, rs78378222) and transcriptional regions (multiple TN1 Transcription variants). TP53 functions as a multifunctional transcription factor that induces cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis upon binding to target DNA sequences. It acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating cell division through controlling expression of genes required for this process, including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. The protein regulates apoptosis by stimulating BAX and FAS expression or repressing Bcl-2 expression. Different TP53 isoforms have distinct regulatory effects: Isoform 2 enhances transactivation activity, Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation and impairs growth suppression, and Isoform 7 inhibits apoptosis. TP53 also regulates circadian rhythms by repressing CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 and induces transcription of regulatory long non-coding RNAs including lincRNA-p21.
