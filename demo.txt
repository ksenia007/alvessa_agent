Q: How many variants are identified for TP53 and KRAS? What does it imply about the genes in terms of regulatory activity??

Answer:
TP53 has 42 variants identified and KRAS has 17 variants identified. This implies that TP53 has significantly higher regulatory activity than KRAS, as evidenced by TP53 variants showing predominantly transcriptional and promoter regulatory classifications (TN1 Transcription, P Promoter) while KRAS variants show more diverse regulatory patterns including heterochromatin and low signal classifications.

Evidence:
  - TP53 gwas_high_risk_snps contains 42 variants
  - KRAS gwas_high_risk_snps contains 17 variants
  - TP53 sei_sequence_class predictions show multiple TN1 Transcription classifications
  - TP53 sei_sequence_class predictions show multiple P Promoter classifications
  - KRAS sei_sequence_class predictions show HET1, HET2, HET3 Heterochromatin classifications
  - KRAS sei_sequence_class predictions show L1, L2, L4, L6 Low signal classifications
  - TP53 function describes it as a multifunctional transcription factor
  - TP53 total_associations is 653 compared to KRAS total_associations of 153
