Q: Tell me about role of TP53 variants in GWAS catalogue

Answer:
TP53 variants show extensive associations in GWAS studies with 239 total associations across 72 studies, with 235 being statistically significant. High-risk SNPs include rs17880847, rs28934576, rs78378222, and others, associated with diverse traits including uterine fibroids, glioblastoma, skin cancer, and metabolic parameters. The variants affect protein levels of multiple targets including AXL, SHBG, and TP53 itself. Regulatory analysis shows variants located in transcriptional regions (TN1-TN4), promoters, and heterochromatin. Pathogenicity predictions identify rs28934576 as pathogenic and rs1042522 as benign. Tissue-specific expression analysis reveals strongest effects in muscle skeletal and keratinocyte tissues.
