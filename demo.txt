Q: How does NUCKS1 play a role in cancer and in viral infections, and what is the overlap of these roles?

Answer:
NUCKS1 plays important roles in both cancer and viral infections through its function as a chromatin-associated protein involved in DNA repair via homologous recombination. In cancer, NUCKS1 interacts with numerous cancer-related proteins including tumor suppressors (MDM2, PARP1), oncogenes (KRAS), DNA repair proteins (BRCA-associated proteins like RBBP4, RBBP5), and chromatin remodeling complexes (SMARCA4, SMARCA5). It shows genetic associations with various cancer-related traits and metabolic factors. In viral infections, NUCKS1 interacts with viral proteins like BRD4 (involved in viral transcription) and TRIM24 (antiviral response), and shows proximity to innate immune signaling proteins (TBK1, RNF8). The overlap between these roles centers on DNA damage response and chromatin regulation - both cancer development and viral infections involve DNA damage and require chromatin modifications for viral replication or oncogenic transformation. NUCKS1's core function in homologous recombination DNA repair makes it a critical factor in both contexts.

Evidence:
  - NUCKS1 function: Chromatin-associated protein involved in DNA repair by promoting homologous recombination (HR)
  - NUCKS1 cancer interactions: MDM2, KRAS, PARP1, RBBP4, RBBP5, SMARCA4, SMARCA5
  - NUCKS1 viral-related interactions: BRD4, TRIM24, TBK1, RNF8
  - NUCKS1 genetic associations: Parkinson's disease, atrial fibrillation, various metabolic traits
  - NUCKS1 DNA binding: Binds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and secondary DNA structures, such as D-loop structures
