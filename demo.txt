Q: Summarize GO terms for TP53

Answer:
TP53 GO terms encompass three main categories: Cellular Component (C), Molecular Function (F), and Biological Process (P). For cellular components, TP53 is localized to the germ cell nucleus, mitochondrion, chromatin, cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus. Its molecular functions include histone deacetylase regulator activity, 14-3-3 protein binding, DNA-binding transcription repressor activity (RNA polymerase II-specific), protein phosphatase 2A binding, receptor tyrosine kinase binding, and molecular function activator activity. The biological processes TP53 participates in include bone marrow development, neuroblast proliferation, regulation of cell cycle G2/M phase transition, somitogenesis, intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway by p53 class mediator, and protein stabilization.

Evidence:
  - C:germ cell nucleus, C:mitochondrion, C:chromatin, C:cytosol, C:endoplasmic reticulum, C:nucleus
  - F:histone deacetylase regulator activity, F:14-3-3 protein binding, F:DNA-binding transcription repressor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific
  - F:protein phosphatase 2A binding, F:receptor tyrosine kinase binding, F:molecular function activator activity
  - P:bone marrow development, P:neuroblast proliferation, P:regulation of cell cycle G2/M phase transition
  - P:somitogenesis, P:intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway by p53 class mediator, P:protein stabilization
