Q: How many variants are identified for TP53 and KRAS? What does it imply about the genes?

Answer:
TP53 has 42 variants identified, while KRAS has 18 variants identified. This implies that TP53 has significantly more genetic variation than KRAS, which is consistent with TP53's role as a major tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated in cancers. The higher number of variants in TP53 suggests it may be under greater selective pressure or have more functional domains that can be affected by mutations.

Evidence:
  - TP53 gwas_high_risk_snps contains 42 variants: rs28934576, rs572488097, rs545492634, rs181067279, rs78378222, rs575993546, rs201214141, rs17881850, rs1642792, rs62062585, rs2303287, rs138932666, rs190543502, rs78496430, rs150844304, rs186426979, rs17883687, rs1042522, rs55745760, rs1625895, rs74351250, rs560191, rs8073498, rs17882854, rs72829457, rs6060001, rs11762311, rs6060003, rs113910919, rs2242069, rs2909430, rs35429877, rs910870, rs2879813, rs2908806, rs34212866, rs62523081, rs4735333, rs896855, rs896854, rs4968204, rs9894946
  - KRAS gwas_high_risk_snps contains 18 variants: rs75130744, rs78444263, rs75667995, rs12320328, rs5011804, rs74758151, rs61759623, rs10948843, rs17389465, rs12527077, rs12318598, rs11964037, rs1395624, rs9464124
  - TP53 function: Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type
  - TP53 diseases: Adrenocortical carcinoma, Basal cell carcinoma 7, Bone marrow failure syndrome 5, Esophageal cancer, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Lung cancer, Papilloma of choroid plexus, Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
  - KRAS function: Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation. Plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells
