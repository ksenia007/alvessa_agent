Q: Is there evidence of protein-protein interaction or functional overlaps between TP53 and KRAS?

Answer:
Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of protein-protein interaction between TP53 and KRAS. However, there are functional overlaps as both proteins are involved in cell proliferation regulation and cancer development, though they have opposing roles - TP53 acts as a tumor suppressor while KRAS promotes oncogenic events.

Evidence:
  - TP53 acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types
  - TP53 negatively regulates cell division by controlling expression of a set of genes required for this process
  - KRAS plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation
  - KRAS plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes
  - Both TP53 and KRAS are associated with various cancer types including gastric cancer and leukemia
