Q: Which diseases and traits are associated with the genes TP53 and KRAS?

[TOOL SELECTION] Claude (Haiku) selected: ['uniprot_base', 'trait_disease', 'trait_function', 'gwas', 'uniprot_gwas']

Answer:
Based on the provided context, KRAS is associated with multiple diseases and traits:

**Diseases:**
- Leukemia, acute myelogenous (AML)
- Leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic (JMML)
- Noonan syndrome 3 (NS3)
- Gastric cancer (GASC)
- Pylocytic astrocytoma (PA)
- Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome 2 (CFC2)
- Oculoectodermal syndrome (OES)
- Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome (SFM)
- Lung carcinoma
- Colorectal cancer
- Pancreatic carcinoma
- Bladder cancer
- Breast carcinoma
- Colon cancer

**Traits from GWAS associations:**
- Free androgen index
- Sex hormone-binding globulin levels
- Body fat percentage
- Alzheimer's disease assessment scale
- Entorhinal cortical volume
- Concentration of small HDL particles
- Right molecular layer hippocampal volume
- Global cognition
- Low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels
- Gamma glutamyl transferase levels
- Mini-mental state examination
- Middle temporal gyrus volume
- Serum albumin levels
- Functional activities questionnaire
- Triglyceride levels
- Total testosterone levels
- Fusiform volume
- Non-HDL cholesterol levels
- Left hippocampal volume
- Whole-brain volume
- Hair colour (blonde)
- Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
- Morning person
- Calcium levels
- Urinary potassium excretion
- Alanine aminotransferase levels

Note: The context provided only contains information about KRAS. No information about TP53 was included in the provided context.

Evidence:
  - KRAS mutations are involved in cancer development
  - The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry
  - Defects in KRAS are a cause of pylocytic astrocytoma
  - gwas_disease_traits include Free androgen index, Sex hormone-binding globulin levels, Body fat percentage
  - gwas_disease_traits include Low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, Gamma glutamyl transferase levels
  - gwas_disease_traits include Hair colour (natural, before greying): Blonde, Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
  - A malignant disease which starts in the stomach
  - An aggressive pediatric myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative disorder
  - A form of Noonan syndrome, a disease characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphic features


# NOTES
TP53 info got basically cut off due to context length

There is some issue in evidence
